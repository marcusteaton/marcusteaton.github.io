	<h4>About Us</h4>
	Based on Bainbridge Island, WA, we provide PC software &amp; hardware support and sales, network setup, server administration, and tech support for the home, home business, and small business sectors for the Bainbridge Island and Poulsbo areas at affordable rates. Crisis Response Unit was formed due to home users and small business users alike needing a simple and effective company to manage their computing and IT resources. Our technicians are highly trained and certified with a variety of industry certifications, along with plenty of previous experience, all while maintaining a friendly and easy to work with composure. Our philosophy is to always do the right thing, and to always aim for the closest possible degree of perfection.
